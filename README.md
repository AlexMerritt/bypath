Snowranger is working to help low-mobility individuals plan trips in cities, by collecting and presenting information about barriers to passage, such as construction and unplowed snow.  We plan to collect this data from the users themselves using a mobile app. Our ultimate goal is to make this a transportation option for Google transit directions for the end-users, and an enforcement tool and a data source for municipalities.
